# Play Next.js Application

PRX audio embed player and landing pages.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have **node**, **NPM**, and **yarn** installed and/or updated.

- `node` - 12.22.0 or later - Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- `yarn` - Wrapper CLI for **npm** that streamlines package retrieval and management.

### Install Node and NPM using NVM

It is recommended to install and update using _Node Version Manager_ (**nvm**). Follow [Installation and Update](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md#installation-and-update) instructions to get started.

Once **nvm** has been installed, use it to install the latest LTS release of **node** and **npm** by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
nvm install --lts
```

### Install Yarn

To install **yarn**, follow their [Installation](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) instructions for your OS. Install the _Stable_ version.

## Setup Development Environment

Now we are ready to clone this repo and get its packages installed and initialized. The following will create a `PRX` directory in your home directory and clone the repo into `~/PRX/Play-Next.js`:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir PRX
cd PRX
git clone git@github.com:PRX/Play-Next.js.git
cd Play-Next.js
```

Now we need to make sure we are using the the version of _node_ need for the app:

```
nvm use
```

Now lets install all the packages required by the app:

```
yarn
```

Finally, lets spin up the development server:

```
yarn dev
```

Then open the app in your browser at [localhost:3000]().

## Typescript and IDE

Yes, We are using typescript. This will require some extra steps to provide explicit types or interfaces for class components, and function parameters and return values. Types and interfaces specific to a component can be exported from the component file. Types and interfaces used by more than one component should be defined in `./interfaces` and organized into its own module directory. Module directories should include a `index.ts` that exports the exported entities from that modules interface files. An export should also be added to `./index.ts` for the module.

It is highly recommended to use an IDE that either supports typescript or has a plugin for typescript. This project provides [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) settings presets for linting and formatting javascript and typescript.

### Importing Module Exports

When importing module exports, do not use relative import paths for exports not local to the importing module. For example, when importing a function from `./lib` in your component in `./components/MyComponent`, use `import myFunction from '@lib/myFunction';` instead of `import myFunction from '../../lib/myFunction';`

#### Available Aliases

- `@components` -> `./components`
- `@contexts` -> `./contexts`
- `@interfaces` -> `./interfaces`
- `@lib` -> `./lib`
- `@svg` -> `./assets/svg`
- `@styles` -> `./styles`
